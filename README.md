# DOSE-GUARDIAN
DoseGuardian is a microcontroller-based smart medication reminder that uses an RTC, LCD, keypad, buzzer, and LEDs to alert patients when it’s time to take medicine. Users can set schedules, receive audio-visual reminders, confirm doses, and track missed medications for safer, more reliable treatment adherence.
